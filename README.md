# Notes
This is a notes on configurations and setup of various libraries & frameworks, which I have used at work or for personal learning. I have created this notes while setting up the corresponding framework/library for application development mostly in C++. It is based on my experience of using the library/framework and I have cited the source in case I have picked it from others on internet.
I have made this notes as my reference so I could revisit when required. I'll be obliged if it finds helpful to anyone looking for related topics posted here.
